The Wdi I’m ready for it.

The WDi (web development intensive) course is run by a company called General Assemby (GA), which started in New York 2011 as an innovative community for entrepreneurs and startup companies.


I’m taking the WDi, this 12 weeks of pure coding and working collaboratively with my fellow students. The course is a deep dive into front-end/back-end development, with some product development in to boot.

GA gave me pre-work to complete before the course starts , so I spend my free time working through it. The pre-work started with an overview of the mac terminal. How to move to different directories (folders), how to create directories , files and how to open them. I’m new to using macs so it did take me a bit of time to get used to GUI and terminal but I when I made a few directories I was fine.


 The course will be full on…..proper full on, but to get the best of it  I need to  (without wanting to sound cheesy) focussed like a laser.  Over the last few weeks I’ve been trying to mentally prepare myself for the adventure. 12 weeks of 9-5 learning and working until the homework/projects are done. I believe this will get me through and I will reap the benefits.

although the WDi will be hard, I’m ready for the challenge!

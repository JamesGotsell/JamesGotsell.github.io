                    <p>I'm a full stack  web developer from South East London. When I spent 18 months working as an english teacher in madrid I had an idea for a website, but I didn't have the skills. So after I returned decided to apply for a place on General Assembly Web Development Intensive. Where I learned how to code and create things.</p>
